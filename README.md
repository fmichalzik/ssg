# Static Site Generator
Welcome. Guided by https://www.boot.dev/ _(kudos to [their course](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-static-site-generator-python))_ i build a static site generator from scratch! A static site generator takes raw content files (like Markdown and images) and turns them into a static website (a mix of HTML and CSS files).
Static sites are very popular in the real world for blogs and other content-heavy websites because they're lightning-fast, secure, and easy to host.
